          <p>
            Vashya Koota assesses how well one partner can influence or ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the other in a marriage. It indicates the level of dominance, submission, or harmony between the couple.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Moon sign of each person is categorized into one of five Vashyas:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Chatushpada</strong> (Quadruped) ‚Äì Aries, Taurus, the second half of Sagittarius, and the first half of Capricorn</li>
            <li><strong>Dwipada</strong> (Biped) ‚Äì Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius, and the second half of Sagittarius</li>
            <li><strong>Jalachara</strong> (Water-dwelling) ‚Äì Cancer, Pisces, the first half of Capricorn</li>
            <li><strong>Vanachara</strong> (Forest-dwelling) ‚Äì Leo</li>
            <li><strong>Keeta</strong> (Insect) ‚Äì Scorpio</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The compatibility is scored based on the relationship between the Vashyas of both partners. Some combinations yield high harmony, while others suggest conflict or imbalance.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Koota contributes a maximum of <strong>2 points</strong> to the overall score.

            üßæ For example, if one partner has a Moon sign in <strong>Chatushpada</strong> (e.g., Taurus) and the other in <strong>Dwipada</strong> (e.g., Libra), the match is moderately compatible and may score <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong> points based on traditional tables.
