                            <strong>Lagna Lord strength</strong> and <strong>7th house lord strength</strong> are also factored while judging dosha impact.

                            Marriage delay or denial from other doshas (like Shrapit, Kemdrum) must also be ruled out.

                            Check <strong>Venus in boy‚Äôs chart</strong> and <strong>Mars + Jupiter in girl‚Äôs chart</strong>. They should not form <strong>2-12</strong> or <strong>6-8</strong> combinations ‚Äî in both <strong>D1 and D9 charts</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Evaluate the <strong>7th lord</strong> of each person in both <strong>D1 and D9</strong> charts:
                            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-1">
                                <li>
                                    Example: If boy‚Äôs 7th lord is <strong>Venus</strong>, then check where it is placed in the girl‚Äôs chart. It should not be in the <strong>6th, 8th, or 12th houses</strong>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It should not be <strong>debilitated</strong>, heavily conjunct with <strong>malefics</strong>, or combust.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Repeat the same check for girl's 7th lord in boy‚Äôs chart.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Similarly, check the <strong>Lagnesh (Ascendant lord)</strong> of both partners in each other‚Äôs chart (D1 and D9), using the same rules as 7th lord evaluation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the <strong>7th lord is placed in 6th, 8th, or 12th house</strong> in either chart, it generally gives <strong>negative results</strong> ‚Äî particularly during the <strong>Mahadasha or Antardasha</strong> of the lord of that house.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Exception:</strong> If there is <strong>Vipreet Raj Yoga</strong> or <strong>Neech Bhang Yoga</strong>, then the negativity is usually <strong>nullified</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            üîÆ <strong>Remedy Tip:</strong> Donate things related to the planet ruling the house where the 7th lord is placed (if it's in 6/8/12) to reduce its negative impact.
