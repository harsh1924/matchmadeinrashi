                    What is Horoscope Matching?
                </h2>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                    Horoscope matching is traditionally based on a 36-point system, evaluating compatibility across 8 distinct categories. This is known as <strong>Ashtkoot Milan</strong>.
                    Itâ€™s an ancient practice in Vedic astrology used to assess compatibility between two individuals for marriage by comparing their birth charts (Janam Kundlis) based on birth date, time, and place.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                    The system evaluates various aspects like personality, health, emotions, behavior, and family harmony. These are traditionally divided into 8 categories, contributing to a total score of 36 points. A higher score indicates stronger astrological compatibility.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                    While many families still rely heavily on this system, itâ€™s important to understand how it works â€” and where modern interpretation allows flexibility. Knowing what each part really means can help you make informed decisions, not just traditional ones.
                </p>

                {/* ðŸŒ• Highlighted Note */}
                <div className="bg-[#fff4d8] border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 rounded-md space-y-3">

                        ðŸ”¸ Matching can also be done based on just the <strong>Nakshatra</strong> (birth star) of the individuals â€” a simpler but widely used method.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-800 text-base leading-relaxed">
                        ðŸ”¸ The <strong>Moon sign (Rashi)</strong> and <strong>Nakshatra</strong> of both people are <strong>extremely important</strong> in horoscope matching.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-800 text-base leading-relaxed">
                        ðŸ”¸ Most of the major doshas â€” like <em>Mangal Dosh</em>, <em>Bhakoot</em>, and <em>Nadi Dosh</em> â€” are identified using the <strong>Moon sign</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-800 text-base leading-relaxed">
                        ðŸ”¸ Matching for <strong>love marriages</strong> is slightly different â€” it focuses more on mental and emotional compatibility, rather than strict Guna score.
